## Hello

Listen, I can barely code anything... so if you use any code from here, please be sure to proofread it. Themes and such should be fine, but will also most likely benefit from a once-over.

Enjoy!

```math
\ce{$\unicode[goombafont; color:red; pointer-events: none; z-index: -10; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; height: 130vh; object-fit: cover; background-size: cover; width: 130vw; opacity: 0.5; background: url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hello-party/hello-party/main/back.png');]{x0000}$}
